## Introduction

For a scalper, quick entry and exit is a most useful feature in a trading app. Scalpers generally tend to trade in 1 or 2 instruments. So, if the app can be pre-configured for trades in those instruments, that will also be helpful.

Before learning scalping options, it would help to learn in a non-derivative instruments such as NIFTYBEES. This app provides such a mechanism. It provides very simple gui and most of the settings are configured before starting the app. Further, the app provides trading NIFTYBEES while the underlying instrument is still NIFTY index.

The app is expected to be very helpful for traders that are trying to learn scalping.

In future versions, buying CE/PE options are also planned.

## Features
Following are the features

- Very simple and intuitive gui
- Uses Bracket order facility of finvasia for trading NIFTYBEES.
- Uses Websocket feed for real time updates.
- Provides mechanism such that feed can be obtained from one Finvasia a/c and trading can be done in another a/c.
- Also has feature to get the session ID from a google sheet.

## Getting Started

### prerequisites
The app has been tested under Python version 3.10.5. Any recent versions also should be able to execute the app.

### Configuration file details
First step after having the repo is to update the Finvasia credentials in the file 'user_cred.yml' which is available in the folder
\data\cred.

Next step is creating the virtual environment for Apps use. For ease of use, a powershell script is given in the ps_scripts folder. To run this, 
you can refer: [Installation](#installation)
